title: "A Little Bit About This Site..."
---
As an introduction to having the website up, Here's some information about this site! 

- This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. 
- This site uses Bootstrap 4 but is heavily customizedi (by me). 
- The font used for most of this website is *Saira Semi Condensed*. The blog section uses *Merriweather*. 
- I like to use VS Code. See below for the screenshot!

```css
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #eee;
  font-family: 'Saira Semi Condensed', sans-serif;
}
```
