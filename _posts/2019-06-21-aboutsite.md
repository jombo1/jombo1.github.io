title: "A Little Bit About This Site..."

Here's some information about my site! 
- This site is powered by **Jekyll** and hosted on GitHub Pages. 
- The theme is a *heavily* customized variation of the basic Bootstrap 4 light theme. 
- The font used for most of this website is Saira Semi Condensed. 
- I like to use VS Code, it's a very nice editor!

```css
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: #eee;
  font-family: 'Saira Semi Condensed', sans-serif;
}
```
