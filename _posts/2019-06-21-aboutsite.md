title: "A Little Bit About This Site..."
---
As an introduction to having the website up, here's some information about this site!

- This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. 
- This site uses a heavily customized Bootstrap 4 theme. Might upload later. 
- The font used for most of this website is *Saira Semi Condensed*. The blog section uses *Merriweather*. 
- I like to use VS Code.

#### Here's a screenshot of my development environment:
